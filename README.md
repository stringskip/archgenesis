# archgenesis
Genesis is an Archlinux-based Linux distribution that i developed for our groups final Thesis Project. Genesis is Lighweight because I uses the xfce desktop environment which is lightweight but still appealing. It is just pre-installed with packages that I believe that are only essential and needed by everyday users. All credits and acknowledgements goes to the Archlinux website, repository and community.

By the time I built this project, I dont know yet how to build custom repo for aur packages so, those packages that you can't find in the packages.both but are thier in the final iso is achieved by chrooting to the iso root directory and installing it their.
