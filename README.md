# archgenesis
Genesis is an Archlinux-based Linux distribution that i developed for our groups final Thesis Project. Genesis is Lighweight because i uses the xfce desktop environment which is lightweight but still appealing. It is just pre-installed with packages that i believe that are only essential and needed by everyday users. All credits and acknowledgements goes to the Archlinux website, repository and community.
